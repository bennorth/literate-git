# Literate git

This package provides tools to turn a structured git history into an
interactive web page.  Development history is broken down into
*sections* and *subsections*, using merge commits.  The resulting web
page allows the reader to page through the sections, expanding and
collapsing them as they wish to see more or less detail.

See [the project homepage](https://github.com/bennorth/literate-git)
for more information and a demo.
